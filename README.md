# Lab Assignment: Configuring a Web Application with HAProxy Load Balancing and MySQL Database on CentOS 7 using Ansible

## Objective
In this lab assignment, you will configure a CentOS 7 environment for deploying a web application with load balancing using HAProxy and a MySQL database backend. You will utilize Ansible to automate the configuration process, focusing on system configurations such as user management, permissions, ulimits, and DNS records. This assignment will help you understand the practical usage of Ansible roles, variables, templates, handlers, and modules.

## Assignment Overview

You have almost a week of time to complete this assignment. Please use your time wisely.

1. **Organize Ansible Playbooks into Ansible Role**:
    - Create your own git repository for this project (optionally, fork this repository, but I would prefer the former)
    - Turn content of this repository into Ansible role which automates the entire configuration and deployment process.
    - Use variables, templates, handlers, and modules in your role. The role must be run be a single command.

1. **Set Up Inventory and Role directory Structure**:
    - Define the inventory of your servers.
    - Setup the main playbook which will run all roles.
    - Set up configuration variables for your web servers, HAProxy, and MySQL database.
    - Set up the role directory structure

2. **System Configuration**:
    - Set up users, permissions, and ulimits.
    - Configure DNS records.

3. **Web Server Deployment**:
    - Install and configure a web server (Apache) on multiple nodes.
    - Install Git and clone a repository into the web application directory.
    - IMPORTANT!!! Git repository containing the webapp iss hardcoded. It absolutely needs to be turned into a variable and declared in the variables section.

4. **MySQL Database Deployment**:
    - Install and configure MySQL on a dedicated database server.
    - Create a database and a user for your web application.

5. **HAProxy Load Balancer Deployment** (Optional):
    - Install and configure HAProxy on a dedicated load balancer node.
    - Set up HAProxy to distribute traffic to the web servers.


## Conditions of Satisfaction

### Deliverables

1. **Ansible Roles - IMPORTANT!!!**:
    - All playbooks must be refactored into sharable roles.
    - When we review, I must to be able to clone your repository and immediatelly run the role after changing the inventory

2. **Web Servers**:
    - Web servers should have the web application installed from the Git repository.
    - The Git repository URL must be moved to the variables section and assigned to a variable instead of being hardcoded.

3. **Corrections**:
    - Correct any mistakes in the playbooks, both structural and syntax.

4. **HAProxy Load Balancing** (Optional):
    - Implement HAProxy load balancing as an additional feature (optional)

### Grading Criteria

- **Correctness and Completeness**:
    - The roles must correctly and completely configure and deploy the required components.
    - The system configurations should include user management, permissions, ulimits, and DNS settings.

- **Proper Use of Ansible Features**:
    - Utilize Ansible variables, templates, handlers, and modules appropriately and effectively.
    - Ensure the Git repository URL is parameterized in the variables section.

- **Accuracy and Security**:
    - Ensure the accuracy and security of system configurations, including users, permissions, ulimits, and DNS records.

- **Functionality**:
    - The deployed web application should function correctly, and the optional HAProxy load balancing should distribute traffic to the web servers effectively.

Have a great weekend!
